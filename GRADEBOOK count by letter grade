We've created a database to track student grades, with their name, number grade, and what percent of activities they've completed.
In this first step, select all of the rows, and display the name, number_grade, and percent_completed, 
which you can compute by multiplying and rounding the fraction_completed column.

SELECT name,number_grade,ROUND(fraction_completed*100) AS percent_completed FROM student_grades;

Now, this step is a little tricky. The goal is a table that shows how many students have earned which letter_grade. 
You can output the letter_grade by using CASE with the number_grade column, outputting 'A' for grades > 90, 
'B' for grades > 80, 'C' for grades > 70, and 'F' otherwise. 
Then you can use COUNT with GROUP BY to show the number of students with each of those grades.

SELECT COUNT(*),
CASE 
WHEN number_grade >90 THEN "A"
WHEN number_grade >80 THEN "B"
WHEN number_grade >70 THEN "C"
ELSE "F"
END as "letter_grade"
FROM student_grades
GROUP BY "letter_grade";
