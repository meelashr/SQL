# For this project, I downloaded Data Scientist salary data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert salary data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

# Creating Table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.ds_salaries
(id integer PRIMARY KEY,
work_year integer,
experience_level text,
employment_type text,
job_title text,
salary integer,
salary_currency text,
salary_in_usd integer,
employee_residence text,
remote_ratio integer,
company_location text,
company_size text)

#Then I inserted the Salary Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#First I looked for which job posiiotn was making the highest salary.

SELECT job_title, MAX(Salary_in_usd) FROM BIT_DB.ds_salaries 
Group By job_title
ORDER by salary_in_usd desc LIMIT 1 

#Then I determeind the average salaries based on the job position.
--SELECT Job_title, AVG(Salary_in_usd) FROM BIT_DB.ds_salaries 
--Group by Job_title
