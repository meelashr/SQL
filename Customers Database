Worked with customers database which contains sales data by month.

Analytics Questions

--How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT Count(orderID) 
From BIT_DB.JanSales

Comment- Used the count clause to find out how many orders were placed in January. 



--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT Count(orderID) 
From BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product="Iphone"

Comment- Used "count" function to find out how many orders and used "where" ask sql to only count iphone.


--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers acc
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales sales
ON acc.order_id= sales.orderID

Comment- Because the account number is in different table(customer) used inner join to join two tables. 
         We only need account number of those coustomers who have placed order in Feb, so we used inner join to get avoid getting null values.)
         
         
         
--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct Product, MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY Product,Price
ORDER BY PRICE ASC LIMIT 1
Comment- Using 'SELECT distinct' will remove duplicate rows from results. 
         The MIN() command will allow to select the smallest value from the price column.

SELECT count(cust.acctnum), AVG (Quantity*Price) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust

--List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) FROM BIT_DB.Febsales

Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? 

SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)

WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'

rows by location which has at least 3 or more orders.

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) As Quanitity FROM BIT_DB.febsales
