# For this project I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


#1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT Count(orderID) 
From BIT_DB.JanSales

Comment- Used the count clause to find out how many orders were placed in January. 


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT Count(orderID) 
From BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product="Iphone"

Comment- Used "count" function to find out how many orders and used "where" ask sql to only count iphone.

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers acc
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales sales
ON acc.order_id= sales.orderID

Comment- Because the account number is in different table(customer) used inner join to join two tables. 
         We only need account number of those coustomers who have placed order in Feb, so we used inner join to get avoid getting null values.)
         
         
         
#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

SELECT distinct Product, MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY Product,Price
ORDER BY PRICE ASC LIMIT 1
Comment- Using 'SELECT distinct' will remove duplicate rows from results. 
         The MIN() command will allow to select the smallest value from the price column.
         Order by 
         
         
         
#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS REVENUE 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product 

Comment-(Revenue calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).



#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, 
how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT product,SUM(quantity),SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE Location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY Product;

Comment-Used Sum(quanity) to find how many of each product were sold, and 
Revenue calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products.


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, 
--and what was the average amount spent for those customers?

SELECT count(cust.acctnum), AVG (Quantity*Price) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.order_ID=cust.order_id
WHERE feb.Quantity>2


#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) FROM BIT_DB.Febsales
WHERE Location like '%los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product

Comment- used '%los Angeles%' to sort the location so that SQL will search for every location within los Angeles. 


#9. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? 

SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID)>2

Comment- Used distinct so that it only returns distint location and no duplicates. Then we counted order id within Newyork, grouped by statement to group 
rows by location which has at least 3 or more orders. 


#10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) As Quanitity FROM BIT_DB.febsales 
WHERE Product like '%Headphones'
GROUP BY Product 

Comment- Asked SQL to look for products with headphones on it and used SUM function to count how many were sold and asked to group the row by product. 


#11. What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT sum(quantity*price)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id

Comment- to find average amount fisrt figured sum total of price spent and divided it by total number of account


#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?

SELECT sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id

Comment- Used the equation (Total quanity divided by total accout number) to find average quantity. 


#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?


SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity*Price) AS Revenue FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product 
ORDER BY SUM(Quantity*Price) Desc LIMIT 1 

Comment- Revenue = quantity of the prodcut multiplied by price. Ask SQL to group the rows by prodcut
         to find the product with most revenue ask SQL to order by descending order and limit only one result which will show the highest only.
