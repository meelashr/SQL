Worked with customers database which contains sales data by month.

Analytics Questions

How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT Count(orderID) From BIT_DB.JanSales
Comment- Used the count clause to find out how many orders were placed in January. 

How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT Count(orderID) From BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE Product="Iphone"

Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers acc
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales sales
ON acc.order_id= sales.orderID
Comment- Because the account number is in different table(customer) used inner join to join two tables. 
         We only need account number of those coustomers who have placed order in Feb, so we used inner join to get avoid getting null values.)
         
Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct Product, MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan 
GROUP BY Product,Price
ORDER BY PRICE ASC LIMIT 1
Comment- Using 'SELECT distinct' will remove duplicate rows from results. 
         The MIN() command will allow to select the smallest value from the price column.
