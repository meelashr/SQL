select all the authors who have written more than 1 million words, using GROUP BY and HAVING. 
Your results table should include the 'author' and their total word count as a 'total_words' column.

SELECT author,SUM (words) AS total_words FROM books
GROUP BY author HAVING total_words > 1000000;

Now select all the authors that write more than an average of 150,000 words per book. 
Your results table should include the 'author' and average words as an 'avg_words' column.

SELECT author,AVG (words) AS avg_words FROM books
GROUP BY author HAVING avg_words > 150000;
