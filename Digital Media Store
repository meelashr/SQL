For this project I worked with dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and 
includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

--SELECT Firstname, LastName, CustomerID, Country 
--FROM chinook.customers
--WHERE Country != "USA"

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

--SELECT * FROM chinook.customers
--WHERE country = "Brazil"

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show 
the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

--SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.invoiceId, i.invoicedate, i.billingcountry
--FROM chinook.invoices i
--LEFT JOIN chinook.customers c
--ON i.customerid=c.customerid
--WHERE i.billingcountry = "Brazil";

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

--SELECT FirstName, LastName From chinook.employees
--WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent"

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM chinook.invoices

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. 
    The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

--SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.invoiceid FROM chinook.employees emp
--JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.SupportRepid=emp.employeeid
--JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON inv.customerid=cust.customerid


#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

--SELECT inv.Total, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, emp.lastname, emp.firstname
--FROM chinook.Employees emp 
--JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
--JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

--SELECT Count(Invoiceid) FROM Chinook.invoices
--WHERE InvoiceDate Like '2009%';

#.9 What are the total sales for 2009?
--SELECT SUM(Total) FROM chinook.invoices
--WHERE InvoiceDate Like '2009%';

#.10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line item.
 
--SELECT tracks.Name, inv.invoiceLineid FROM chinook.tracks
--JOIN chinook.invoice_items inv ON tracks.Trackid= inv.Trackid;

#.11 Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line item.

--SELECT trac.name, art.Name, inv.invoiceLineId 
--FROM chinook.invoice_items inv 
--JOIN chinook.tracks trac ON trac.Trackid=inv.Trackid
--JOIN chinook.albums alb ON alb.Albumid=trac.Albumid
--JOIN chinook.artists art ON art.Artistid=alb.Artistid

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks,
     and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

--SELECT trac.Name as Tracks_Name, alb.Title as Album_Name, med.name as Mediatype, gen.Name as Genre
--FROM chinook.tracks trac 
--JOIN chinook.albums alb ON trac.Albumid=alb.Albumid
--JOIN chinook.media_types med ON trac.MediaTypeid= med.mediaTypeid
--JOIN chinook.genres gen ON trac.Genreid=gen.Genreid;

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

--SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(total),2) as TOTAL_Sales FROM chinook.invoices i
--JOIN chinook.customers c ON c.Customerid=i.Customerid
--JOIN chinook.employees e ON e.Employeeid=c.supportRepid
--WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
--GROUP By e.FirstName

#14. Which sales agent made the most in sales in 2009?

--SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(total),2) as TOTAL_Sales FROM chinook.invoices i
--JOIN chinook.customers c ON c.Customerid=i.Customerid
--JOIN chinook.employees e ON e.Employeeid=c.supportRepid
--WHERE e.title = 'Sales Support Agent' AND InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
--GROUP By e.FirstName
--ORDER BY TOTAL_Sales DESC
--LIMIT 1;
