For this project I worked on data sets from a Furniture Store sales database.

SELECT COUNT(product) FROM sales;

SELECT product, MAX(PRICE) FROM sales;

SELECT SUM(PRICE) FROM sales;

SELECT product, COUNT(product) as total_product_sale FROM sales GROUP BY product;

SELECT country, COUNT(COUNTRY) as total_purchases FROM sales GROUP BY country;

SELECT AVG(PRICE) FROM Sales;
SELECT MAX(PRICE) FROM sales;
SELECT MIN(PRICE) FROM sales;


Ran SQL to check which country bought how many and which prodcuts. For couch and chair I needed to use HAVING statement because more than one country
bought same products. 

SELECT country,product, COUNT(product) from sales group by country HAVING product = "Couch";

SELECT country,product, COUNT(product) AS Total_purchases from sales group by country HAVING product = "Chair";

SELECT country, product, COUNT(product) AS Total_purchases FROM sales WHERE product="Bed";



SELECT payment_type, COUNT(payment_type) FROM Sales GROUP by payment_type;


Ran SQL to check most, somewhat and least popular products:

SELECT Product, COUNT(product) as total_purchases,
CASE WHEN Count(product) > 80 THEN "Most Popular"
     WHEN Count(product) > 10 THEN "Somewhat Popular"
ELSE "Least popular"
END AS Popularity
FROM sales GROUP by product;
